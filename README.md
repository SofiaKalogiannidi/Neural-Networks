# Neural-Networks
At first I created a Feed Forward Neural Network in order to perform Sentiment analysis on imdb reviews. The dataset is included in a zip file. Afterwards, I repeat the procedure with a Recurrent Neural Network. You can find all the Google collab notebooks, with the learning curves designed to make sure there were no overfitting or underfitting problems
